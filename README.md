This repository contains Dockerfiles to build Ansible container images. These images can be used for testing purposes such as unit-tests and validation/linting of yaml/python files.

The focus of these images are on networking, but they should be usable for most other usecases.

For now the images consist of Python:3.6-alpine as the base. Ansible and the networking tools are added on top of these.

## Extra packages

* ansible-lint - Validates and Ansible files for syntax and style
* pytest - Runs doc and unit tests
* yamllint - Validates yaml files for syntax and style
